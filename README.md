# 2048 game

Implementation of 2048, core game functionality 
based on [PavlyukVadim/amadev](https://github.com/PavlyukVadim/amadev).
You will find the original script in `src/lib/amadev/original.script`.

The amadev code is rewritten to be object oriented 
classes within a module - with added functionality.

[VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) is used to create the UI around the game.

## Quick start:
Requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), install if you don't have it.
Clone this repo. Then in a terminal, go to this repo directory and type:
```bash
npm install --production
npm run serve
```

And the app will run by default on http://localhost:8080/
